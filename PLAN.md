# Quilt Development Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Development Environment (✅ Complete)

*   Set up basic project structure for a container runtime in Rust (using suitable Linux distribution).
*   Install required dependencies:
    *   Rust toolchain with necessary crates (`tokio`, `tonic`, `nix`, etc.)
    *   Protobuf compiler and development libraries
    *   Linux development tools

*   Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt install build-essential protobuf-compiler libprotobuf-dev pkg-config libssl-dev`
*   RedHat/CentOS: `sudo yum install gcc protobuf-devel openssl-devel pkg-config`

*   Set up gRPC service definitions in `proto/quilt.proto`
*   Implement basic gRPC server structure with Tonic
*   Create minimal CLI client to interact with the server

## Phase 2: Container Runtime Core

### **✅ [Checkpoint: Basic Container Creation]**

The goal is to implement a basic container creation flow that:
*   Accepts a container image (tarball) and extracts it to create a rootfs
*   Creates Linux namespaces for isolation (PID, mount, network, etc.)
*   Mechanism to use a base rootfs tarball (e.g., from Nix builds). The `CreateContainerRequest` will specify the path to this tarball.
*   Executes a specified command inside the container with proper isolation

**✅ [Checkpoint: Transition to Nix Development Focus]**

Having established the basic runtime, namespace (`unshare`, `clone`, `pivot_root`, cgroups), prioritize setting up a Nix development environment.
*   **Nix Development**: Configure the Rust toolchain for Nix-based development. Ensure `quiltd` can be built properly with all dependencies compatible.
*   ✅ **Iterative Testing on Nix**: All subsequent features in Phase 2 should be regularly tested in the Nix environment to catch compatibility issues early. The goal is to ensure `quiltd` behaves as expected on the target platform.

### Key Features to Implement:

1.  **Namespace Management**: Properly isolate processes using Linux namespaces.
2.  **Root Filesystem Setup**: Extract container images and set up mount points.
3.  **Process Execution**: Safely execute commands within containers using `exec` family functions.
4.  **Basic Resource Management**: Implement cgroups for memory and CPU limits.
5.  **Container State Management**: Track container states (pending, running, exited, failed).
6.  **Logging**: Capture and store container stdout/stderr.
7.  **Cleanup**: Proper resource cleanup when containers stop or are removed.
8.  **Setup Commands**: Implement logic to run setup commands (e.g., package manager commands) inside the container *before* the main tool command. This means `exec`-ing these commands sequentially within the container's environment.

## Phase 3: Advanced Features

### Container Lifecycle Management

*   Start/stop containers with proper signal handling
*   Graceful shutdown with configurable timeouts
*   Container removal and cleanup
*   Health checks and monitoring

### Networking

*   Basic networking setup (loopback interface)
*   Optional: Port forwarding and network namespaces
*   Optional: Container-to-container networking

### Storage

*   Persistent volume mounting

### Security

*   User namespace mapping
*   Capability management
*   Seccomp profiles (optional)

*   Image verification

### Orchestration

*   Basic scheduling
*   Service discovery
*   Load balancing
