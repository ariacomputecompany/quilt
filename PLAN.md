# Quilt Development Checklist

## Phase 1: Foundation & Development Environment
- ✅ Set up basic project structure for container runtime in Rust
- ✅ Install Rust toolchain with necessary crates (tokio, tonic, nix, etc.)
- ✅ Install protobuf compiler and development libraries
- ✅ Install Linux development tools
- ✅ Set up gRPC service definitions in proto/quilt.proto
- ✅ Implement basic gRPC server structure with Tonic
- ✅ Create minimal CLI client to interact with the server

## Phase 2: Container Runtime Core
- ✅ Accept container image (tarball) and extract to create rootfs
- ✅ Create Linux namespaces for isolation (PID, mount, network, etc.)
- ✅ Execute specified command inside container with proper isolation
- ✅ Configure Rust toolchain for Nix-based development
- ✅ Implement namespace management for process isolation
- ✅ Root filesystem setup with image extraction and mount points
- ✅ Safe process execution using exec family functions
- ✅ Basic resource management with cgroups for memory and CPU limits
- ✅ Container state management (pending, running, exited, failed)
- ✅ Logging system to capture and store container stdout/stderr
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup when containers stop or are removed
- ✅ Setup commands execution before main command

## Phase 3: Advanced Features
